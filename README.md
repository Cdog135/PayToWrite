# PayToWrite
Overview
Pay-to-Write Wall is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain using the Sepolia testnet. Users can connect their MetaMask wallet, pay a small fee in ETH per character, and submit messages that are stored on the blockchain. The messages are then displayed on the webpage for everyone to see. The project is deployed on Firebase Hosting and interacts with a smart contract written in Solidity.

Features
Connect to MetaMask wallet on the Sepolia testnet.
Submit messages to the blockchain by paying a fee (0.001 ETH per character).
View all submitted messages on the webpage, including the senderâ€™s address, timestamp, and amount paid.
Smart contract includes owner-only functions like withdrawing funds and changing the cost per character.
